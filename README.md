# Dupe List

Dupe List is a C# .NET 4 desktop application that scans a folder recursively and prints out a list of files. Selected files can then be individually deleted.

## Run instructions

Download, open with Visual Studio, compile, and run. Requires the .NET 4 Client Profile framework, and Windows XP SP3 and up.

## Planned Features

Feature wishlist includes:

* Choosing algorithm to determine duplicates (with speed delay)
* Supporting images (detecting image similarities based on threshold)
* More filter options on results screen (i.e. "Select first file", "Select all but first file")
* Windows 7/8 taskbar progress integration

## Contributing

Fork it, make improvements (add one of the features above!), commit, and send me a pull request. Easy!
